## Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In today's interconnected world, seamless collaboration on documents among multiple users is essential for productivity and efficiency. The **Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor** is a cutting-edge application designed to facilitate simultaneous editing of shared documents by multiple users in real time. This project harnesses the power of modern web technologies, including **NestJS** for the backend, **WebSocket** for real-time communication, and robust authentication mechanisms to ensure data security and user privacy.

## Key Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Real-Time Collaboration**  
   Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously, with changes instantly visible to all collaborators.  

2. **Document & User Management**  
   Comprehensive tools for creating, editing, and organizing documents, as well as managing user profiles and permissions.  

3. **Identification and Mapping of WebSocket Clients**  
   Each WebSocket client is uniquely identified and mapped to the corresponding user in the database, ensuring secure communication and tracking.  

4. **Authentication & Authorization**  
   Secure login and role-based access control using JWT to ensure only authorized users can access or modify documents.  

5. **Conflict Resolution**  
   Intelligent algorithms to handle edit conflicts gracefully, ensuring no data is lost during simultaneous updates.  

6. **Persistence**  
   All changes are stored persistently in the database, ensuring that no data is lost even if a user disconnects or the application restarts.  

7. **Maintaining DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**  
   Ensures clean and consistent data flow between the frontend and backend.  

8. **Class-Validator & Class-Transformer**  
   Provides robust validation and transformation of data, improving code maintainability and reducing errors.
